            <h4>Since June 2017 </h4>
            <p>Technical customer service field engineer for the commercial tire division responsible for our strategic accounts. I am the main technical contact for each account across North America and handle all topics regarding technical training, warranty claims, product performance complaints, and others. </p>
            <p>Additionally I have been developing and improving our Fleet Visit Evaluation Report database which is helping to track and report on our field engineers visits through country. The database started in Microsoft Access and has moved to Sharepoint while I complete the development of the SQL server.</p>
            <p>Due to the travel, which is upwards of 90%, my role is very dependent on my ability to manage my time and generate buy-in from other local sales reps to ensure all customer locations are serviced in a timely manner. I typically interface with other field engineers, the account owners, local sales reps, research and development, and production mangers to ensure the data I am gathering satisfies their expectations.</p>

            <p>Continuing my undergraduate research in developing real-life applications for desktop and at-home 3-D printers I was also responsible for assisting in the undergraduate research projects ensuring knowledge was successfully transferred between students. </p>
            <p>Main research focus was on developing low-cost solar photovoltaic racking systems utilizing 3-D printing and the systems developed showed a potential for 80% cost reduction compared to commercially available alternatives. </p>
            <p>Additionally, I consulted with schools to adopt 3-D printing in the classroom and facilitated teachers’ expertise of the technology with non-profit partner <a href="http://www.squareonenetwork.org">Square One</a> via 3-D printer building workshops and continued support. </p>
